# CPP 01

## Project Overview

**CPP 01** expands upon foundational object-oriented principles by introducing memory allocation, references, pointers, and class composition.

This project focused on:

- Creating and destroying objects with control over memory  
- Differentiating between heap and stack allocation  
- Using references and pointers appropriately  
- Designing class interaction and ownership 
- Managing file I/O with string substitution  
- Using pointers to member functions instead of nested conditionals  

---

### Exercise 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ  
**Goal:** Implement a simple Zombie class with the ability to announce itself and investigate differences between stack and heap allocation.

**Key concepts:**  
- Stack vs Heap allocation
- Constructors and destructors

---

### Exercise 01: Moar brainz!  
**Goal:** Create a dynamically allocated horde of Zombie instances and manage their lifecycle.

**Key concepts:**  
- Dynamic memory allocation   
- Manual deallocation and leak checking  

---

### Exercise 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN  
**Goal:** Understand how pointers and references behave in C++ by comparing their behavior and memory addresses.

**Key concepts:**  
- Pointers vs References  
- Memory address vs value  
- Reference semantics  

---

### Exercise 03: Unnecessary violence  
**Goal:** Implement two different types of Human classes to explore object relationships and composition using weapons.

**Key concepts:**  
- Class composition  
- Object ownership models  
- Reference vs pointer semantics   

---

### Exercise 04: Sed is for losers  
**Goal:** Perform string replacement on the contents of a file and output the modified version into a new file.

**Key concepts:**  
- File input/output with C++ streams  
- String parsing and substitution  
- Robust input validation   

---

### Exercise 05: Harl 2.0  
**Goal:** Implement dynamic dispatching of class methods using pointers to member functions to simulate conditional behavior without if/else.

**Key concepts:**  
- Pointers to member functions
- Function dispatching  
- Mapping string input to behavior
